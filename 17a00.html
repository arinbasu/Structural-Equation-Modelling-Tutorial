<div></div><div>In this model, you can see six boxes, six short circlces, and one oval. The boxes contain the scores for a set of six variables. These six variables are related to each other in some way that is, together they can be coerced into a covariance matrix which can then be analysed. The boxes are observed variables, referred to as "manifest variables". The small circles are the errors (these are unobserved variables). The large oval is the latent variable, which is an underlying construct that can explain the variances (variability) of the manifest variables. Thus the manifest variables have shared variace</div><div></div><div>Build and test a structural model</div><div></div>

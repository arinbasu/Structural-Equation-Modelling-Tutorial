<div></div><div>In this model, you can see six boxes, six short circles, and one oval. The boxes contain the scores for a set of six variables. These six variables are related to each other in some way that is, together they can be coerced into a covariance matrix which can then be analysed. The boxes contain observed variables (E1 ... E6), referred to as "manifest variables". The small circles (c1 ... c6) are the errors (these are unobserved variables). The large oval is the latent variable, which is an underlying construct that can explain the variances (variability) of the manifest variables. Thus the manifest variables have shared variances, part of which is explained by the common variable, the latent variable, and part of which is explained by the errors (each error for each manifest variable). When you set up a measurement model, you are essentially conducting a confirmatory factor analysis. In a CFA:</div><div></div><ul><li>You hypothesize a construct (call it latent variable), this will come from your theory, and you should do it <i>a priori</i></li><li>Then you collect sample data and fit the model</li><li>You do this to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the model. That is, are there items that are similar enough that they can be grouped together that the underlying latent variable can have their shared variance? This is the basis of convergent validity. Also, are there variables that are so different or distinct from others that they can differentiate whether the common underlying variable (latent variable) can again, explain their own variance, yet they are distinct from other variables (see an example below)</li><li>After you achieve a model fit, then you fit a second set&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div><div>Build and test a structural model</div><div></div>

<div></div><div>In this model, you can see six boxes, six short circlces, and one oval. The boxes contain the scores for a set of six variables. These six variables are related to each other in some way that is, together they can be coerced into a covariance matrix which can then be analysed. The boxes are observed variables, referred to as The small circles are the errors (these are unobserved variables).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Build and test a structural model</div><div></div>

<div></div><div>In this model, you can see six boxes, six short circles, and one oval. The boxes contain the scores for a set of six variables. These six variables are related to each other in some way that is, together they can be coerced into a covariance matrix which can then be analysed. The boxes contain observed variables (E1 ... E6), referred to as "manifest variables". The small circles are the errors (these are unobserved variables). The large oval is the latent variable, which is an underlying construct that can explain the variances (variability) of the manifest variables. Thus the manifest variables have shared variances, part of which is explained by the common variable, the latent variable, and part of which is explained by the errors (each error for each manifest variable).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Build and test a structural model</div><div></div>

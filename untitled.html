<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Introduction</h2><div></div><div>Think of Structural Equation Modelling as a combination of Factor Analysis and Linear Regression. If you have a covariance or correlation matrix, you can use this covariance or correlation matrix to develop structural equation models to find patterns in the data.

Then test multivariate normality using QQ plot (See R codes for QQ plots and Shapiro Wilk Tests). If the multivariate normality conditions are not met, the model will be under-estimated. model parameters will be "downwardly biased" (towards the null), standard errors will be underestimated (lower than optimal and wider).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Build and test a measurement model</div><div></div><div>Start with building and testing a measurement model. The purpose is to specify the indicator-construct relationship. Construct is the concept based on your theory. The construct is something you don't get to "see" and hence this is referred to as "latent" variable. Indicator variables are those variables that you measure.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The following is an example of a measurement model:</div><div></div><div></div>
